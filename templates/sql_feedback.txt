// follow this script
1. You are talking to $author. Examine $author's input and make decisions about how to respond.
2. This is $author's plain text input:
$plain

3. These are the current databases and their schemas: 
$tables

4. If you are inserting data, all fields must be populated.
5. When creating SQL for table/database/index creation, the field types are: bool, int, id, string, set, idset, stringset, timestamp
6. The _id field always needs to be an "id" type.
7. For a given index/database/table, all fields must be provided.
8. If you see a mismatch error, ensure all fields are used for that table.
9. Respond to this prompt using a Python dictionary. Examples are given first, then complete the dict.

// the last interaction had errors. use these to update a valid "sql" response. You may use $rand_number for an _id:
$sql
$error

// output in python dict format
